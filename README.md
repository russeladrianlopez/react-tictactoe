A single-page **ReactJs TicTacToe Game** for starters, following the [Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html), optional [Additional Task](#additional-task) to improve the game were provided to solve on you're own. Solved all the additional task, added a little bit more improvements, used **yarn**, **create-react-app**, and **surge** for deployment.
